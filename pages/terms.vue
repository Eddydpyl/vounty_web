        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>The following terms of use are a work in progress, and thus subject to changing at any time, as is everything else in this website. We at Vounty are just starting up, testing the waters to see how feasible this project is, and how much interest there is from the community. There are however some guarantees we can still give you. After all, there's money involved, and you must be able to trust us.</p>
        <h2>On starting a new vounty</h2>
        <p>Anyone can create a vounty, for anything they like. That being said, we may still apply our own criteria and remove a vounty that we consider to be illegal, immoral, or dangerous in any way. A more precise set of criteria has yet to be defined, and we understand this gives us a great deal of freedom to do as we like. For the time being though, it's the only real option for us. Rest assured that your money will always be returned in full if we decide to take down a vounty you created or funded.</p>
        <h2>On funding a vounty</h2>
        <p>Funding a vounty is a commitment on your part, to reward someone for completing an objective, no matter how long they may take to do so, and so it's generally irreversible. Unless the vounty is taken down, or some other special circumstances prompt us to return you your money, you can assume your contribution to be non refundable. If you think there's a valid reason for a refund, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:admin@vounty.io" target="_blank">admin@vounty.io</a></p>
        <h2>On claiming a vounty</h2>
        <p>If you have made a submission for claiming a vounty, whether or not the prize is yours is up to those that have contributed to said vounty. Simply put, if more than half of those that contributed decide that you've delivered what they were looking for, then the vounty is yours. It's clear that this system is easily exploitable, so the process is not completely automatic, and requires the input of an administrator.</p>
        <h2>About fraud prevention</h2>
        <p>As the system is still in its infancy, it's possible that some unscrupulous individuals will try to take advantage of it, to make away with the money of others. This is an inevitability, and so our only option while the system matures is to take exceptional measures when verifying our users' submissions. Any swindler will have to convince a team of very internet savvy people before getting their hands on a single dollar.</p>
        <p>In the case that something did happen, Vounty and those behind it will not be held responsible in any way. We make our utmost effort to ensure the prize money always goes to someone that truly deserves it, but unlike what many other companies would make you believe, we're just people, and we're fallible.</p>
