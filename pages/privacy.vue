        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p>In order to guarantee that the processing of personal data is explained to you in a transparent and understandable way, we would like to inform you about the various legal terms, which will also be used in this privacy declaration:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><b>Pseudonymisation</b> means the processing of personal data in such a way that personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without adding additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separate and subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data cannot be assigned to an identified or identifiable natural person.</li>
          <li><b>Filing system</b> means any structured set of personal data which are accessible according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional or geographical basis.</li>
          <li><b>Controller</b> means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</li>
          <li><b>Processor</b> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</li>
          <li><b>Recipient</b> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.</li>
          <li><b>Third party</b> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</li>

          Lawfulness of processing
        </h2>
        <p>The processing of personal data shall only be lawful if there is a legal basis for processing. According to article 6, section 1 a – f GDPR, a legal basis can be as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
          <li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
          <li>Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li>
          <li>Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.</li>
          <li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</li>
          <li>Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.</li>
        </ul>

          Use of external tools on our website
        </h2>
        <p>We have integrated various tools from different companies into our website, which allow us to evaluate user behavior or to establish links with other websites.</p>
        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>The controller has integrated the component Google Analytics (with anonymisation function) on this website.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the gathering, collection and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects data on which website a data subject has come to a website from (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>
        <p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google might transfer the personal information collected via this technical procedure to third parties.</p>
        <p>As IP anonymization is activated on our website, your IP address will be shortened by Google within Member States of the European Union or other states in agreement with the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by a Google server in the USA. On behalf of the operator of the website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activity and to provide further services related to website and internet use to us. The IP address transferred through your browser to Google Analytics will not be combined with other data held by Google.</p>
        <p>In addition, this website uses the Analytics feature UserID to track interaction data. This User ID will be additionally anonymized and encrypted and will not be linked with other data.</p>
        <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website to the fullest extent possible.</p>
        <p>In addition, you may prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">link</a></p>
        <p>This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about website visits may be transmitted to Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.</p>
        <p>Further information and Google‘s applicable privacy regulations can be found at the following <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">link</a></p>
        <p>Our website also uses Google Analytics performance reports relating to demographics and interests and reports on Google Display Network impressions. You can disable Google Analytics for display advertising and customize the ads on the Google Display Network by visiting the ad settings at this <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">link</a></p>
        <h3>Stripe</h3>
        <p>The controller has integrated the component Stripe on this website for processing payments.</p>
        <p>Neither the controller nor Stripe retain any financial information you may submit as part of the purchasing process. Stripe monitors every transaction 24/7 to prevent fraud, email phishing, and identity theft. Every transaction is heavily guarded behind Stripe's advanced encryption. If something appears suspicious, their dedicated team of security specialists will identify it and help protect you from fraudulent transactions.</p>
        <p>Your data is encrypted before transmission to prevent misuse of the transmitted data by third parties. Your personal data, including credit card information, login data and payment method, are securely transferred via the Internet. The data is encrypted so that is only readable by the Stripe payment system. </p>
        <p>No personal financial information is ever taken or stored in our systems during the payment process. Everything is transferred out to Stripe so that we don't have access to your financial information.</p>
        <p>Stripe’s services in Europe are provided by a Stripe affiliate — Stripe Payments Europe Limited (“Stripe Payments Europe”) — an entity located in Ireland. In providing Stripe Services, Stripe Payments Europe transfers personal data to Stripe, Inc. in the US.</p>
        <p>Further information and Stripe‘s applicable privacy regulations can be found at the following <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy" target="_blank">link</a></p>
